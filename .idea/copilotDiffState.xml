              <option name="originalContent" value="# PsydeKick &#10;a Streamlit app with a handful of useful tools for research teams&#10;&#10;This project contains everything needed to run the **PsydeKick** Streamlit app.&#10;&#10;## Contents&#10;&#10;-  `requirements.txt` ‑ your venv environment requirements&#10;-  `run_app.py` ‑ launcher script for Streamlit&#10;-  `makefile` ‑ for rebuilding the packed environment&#10;-  `main.py` - handles the UI and routing&#10;- `/workflows` ‑ contains the modules for each workflow&#10;- `/utils` ‑ contains utility functions and classes used by the application broadly&#10;- `/config`, - contains study-specific configuration files&#10;- `/tests` ‑ contains unit tests for the workflows&#10;&#10;## Researchers: Run the app (default usage)&#10;&#10;The default and recommended way to use PsydeKick is to run it from the terminal. This works for both Intel and M-series Macs, and is the most up-to-date method for researchers.&#10;&#10;### macOS&#10;1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.&#10;2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.&#10;3. For Intel Macs:&#10;   ```bash&#10;   make setup-venv-x86_64&#10;   source .venv-x86_64/bin/activate&#10;   ```&#10;   For M-series Macs:&#10;   ```bash&#10;   make setup-venv-arm64&#10;   source .venv-arm64/bin/activate&#10;   ```&#10;4. Run the app:&#10;   ```bash&#10;   python run_app.py&#10;   ```&#10;5. The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.&#10;&#10;### Windows&#10;Windows is not officially supported, but you may run the app from the terminal if you have Python 3.10+ and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.&#10;&#10;## Common troubleshooting steps&#10;If you encounter any issues running the app, try the following steps:&#10;1. Check the operating system requirements:&#10;   - macOS 11 or later (Intel and M-series Macs are supported with their respective virtual environments/builds)&#10;   - The earliest supported MacOS we've tested is Sonoma&#10;2. Ensure you have the latest version of the app. And are not trying to run an old version.&#10;&#10;### I'm clicking the app and it doesn't open&#10;1. If the app doesn't open in your browser, try manually navigating to http://localhost:8501.&#10;2. If you see a message about being unable to connect, the app may be having trouble starting for some reason.&#10;   1. Try moving the app to your Desktop and then running `~Desktop/PsydeKick.app/Contents/MacOS/PsydeKick` in the terminal. The terminal output should give you more error information.&#10;   2. If you see an error about another process using port 8501, it's possible that a previous run of the app or another streamlit app has failed to exit. You can try to stop that existing process by running:&#10;      ```bash&#10;      kill $(lsof -t -i:8501)&#10;      ```&#10;3. You can also try running the app from the terminal as described in the &quot;Run the app&quot; section above. This will give you more detailed error messages if something goes wrong. &#10;   1. If you see an error about missing dependencies, make sure you have the correct virtual environment activated and that you've run `make setup-venv-x86_64` or `make setup-venv-arm64` as appropriate.&#10;&#10;## Issues?&#10;If you encounter any issues, after trying the troubleshooting steps, please open a ticket in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ddemarco96/research-helpers)&#10;&#10;## Feedback and feature requests&#10;If you have any feedback or feature requests, please open a ticket in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ddemarco96/research-helpers)&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;## Optional: One-click app and distribution (may be applicable for some users)&#10;&#10;Some users may receive a bundled one-click version of PsydeKick (macOS only). These instructions are for those cases, but are not the default use case.&#10;&#10;### macOS One-click App&#10;You may receive a zipped folder containing the app as a dmg file.&#10;1. Double-click the dmg file to mount it.&#10;2. Drag the PsydeKick app to your Applications folder, Desktop, etc.&#10;3. Double-click the app to run it.&#10;   - You may need to right-click and select &quot;Open&quot; if you get a warning about it being from an unidentified developer.&#10;4. The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.&#10;5. If the browser doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to http://localhost:8501.&#10;&#10;### Building, Signing, and Notarizing the App (for maintainers)&#10;If you need to rebuild, sign, or notarize the app for distribution:&#10;1. A Mac with Xcode installed&#10;2. An Apple Developer account (paid)&#10;3. A `Developer ID Application` certificate&#10;4. An `App-Specific Password` for the Apple NotaryTool&#10;&#10;Update the makefile's `DEV_APP_ID` variable as needed, then run:&#10;```bash&#10;make dist-mac&#10;make notarize-both&#10;```&#10;This will create new dmg files for both Intel and Silicon architectures in the `dist` folder.&#10;&#10;Testing before distribution:&#10;```bash&#10;make build-mac&#10;```&#10;&#10;**Note:** If you are self-distributing, you may need to update the icon files in the `icons/` folder to match your branding or requirements.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;## Contributing&#10;We welcome contributions via pull requests! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new features, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure your code is well-documented and passes all existing tests.&#10;&#10;## Issues&#10;If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, please open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ddemarco96/research-helpers). This helps us track bugs and feature requests efficiently.&#10;" />
